# disturbed_logistic
This model computes and plots the single-species population size for a randomly disturbed population growth model. Disturbances of random magnitude occur at random times given by a Poisson event process.  Between disturbances the population experiences deterministic, logistic growth.  When a disturbance occurs, the population size is multiplied by a random disturbance factor between 0 and 1.  For details and mathematical results for this model, see: Peckham, Waymire and De Leenheer (2018), Critical thresholds for eventual extinction in randomly disturbed population growth models, Journal of Mathematical Biology.
